      "reasoning": "Supplier B (Axion Automotive) demonstrates a solid baseline for sustainability by holding a current ISO 14001:2015 certification for environmental management and complying with multiple material regulations like REACh and RoHS. They also show an understanding of circular economy principles by highlighting remanufacturing capabilities and the use of non-hazardous materials. However, the supplier's approach appears more reactive and compliance-focused rather than proactive and strategic. The most significant weakness is that decarbonization solutions are mentioned as a possibility but are not integrated or costed into the current proposal, suggesting this is not a core part of their strategy. Furthermore, compliance on specific substance restrictions is still pending, and there is no information on energy efficiency or social responsibility programs. The score of 3 reflects a supplier that meets essential environmental standards but does not yet demonstrate leadership or a comprehensive, forward-looking sustainability commitment aligned with group-wide goals.",

The peak forecast volume for 2029 is 152,500 units, which significantly exceeds the supplier's documented nominal annual capacity of 130,000 units for key components. This risk is amplified because the capacity is shared with other customers, including 'American Hauler' and 'Other OEM', further constraining availability. A second high-severity risk is the exceptionally long raw material procurement lead time of 95 working days, which creates significant vulnerability to upstream supply chain disruptions. While the supplier demonstrates strengths in final-stage logistics, such as a short 9-day average lead time to the customer plant, JIT and EDI capabilities, and operates in a low-risk country (France, score 1.8), these are insufficient to overcome the fundamental capacity and raw material sourcing risks. The supplier's OTIF performance of 94% is only adequate, and its 3.0 percentage point variability indicates inconsistency. Contingency planning is also a concern, with internal backup systems only being 'partly' available. Although a capacity expansion is mentioned, the lack of concrete details makes this a major unmitigated risk.",
