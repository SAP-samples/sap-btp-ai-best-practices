Review this knowledge graph extraction against the original text:

ORIGINAL TEXT:

EXISTING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH:
Total Nodes: {node_count}
Total Relationships: {relationship_count}

Carefully compare the original text with the existing knowledge graph and identify:

1. MISSING ENTITIES: Any important entities (parts, suppliers, costs, locations, etc.) mentioned in the text but not captured as nodes
2. MISSING RELATIONSHIPS: Any connections between entities described in the text but not captured as relationships
