# Pharma Synthetic Data Prototype

This repository contains a **self-contained example** designed to generate and validate synthetic datasets for testing scenarios related to **upcoming U.S. pharmaceutical legislation changes** expected next year.  
The purpose of this project is to provide a reproducible prototype that allows teams to experiment with realistic data structures and validation rules without relying on sensitive or proprietary information.

## üìå Key Features

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - Creates structured pharmaceutical sales and distribution records.  
   - Mimics real-world fields such as wholesaler, sales document type, order details, material identifiers, NDC codes, and pricing.  
   - Includes variability for testing edge cases (aberrant blocks, abnormal volumes, compliance flags, etc.).

2. **Validation Approaches**  
   - Built-in checks on data consistency (e.g., numeric ranges, averages, exceeded thresholds).  
   - Flags for conditions relevant to compliance, such as exceeding 90-day averages, customer block reasons, and order validation logic.  
   - Clear separation between **valid data**, **outliers**, and **legislative triggers**.

3. **Testing Focus**  
   - Supports test cases for evaluating processes impacted by pharmaceutical regulation updates.  
   - Demonstrates how machine learning models or rule-based systems can be applied to detect anomalies.  
   - Provides a foundation for discussions on automation and compliance monitoring.

## üß© Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into three main steps:

1. **Run Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - Produces a dataset of pharmaceutical transactions with realistic patterns and anomalies.  

2. **Synthetic Data Validation**  
   - Applies validation rules to detect outliers, blocked customers, abnormal orders, and compliance thresholds (e.g., 90-day averages).  

3. **Enhanced ML Modelling**  
   - Demonstrates how machine learning methods can be applied on top of validation outputs to classify cases and support compliance automation.

## üîç Relevance to U.S. Regulatory Changes

Beginning in **2026**, U.S. pharmaceutical distributors and manufacturers will be subject to **stricter requirements** under the **Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA)** full interoperability mandate and related FDA guidance.  
Key aspects include:  

- End-to-end electronic tracing of prescription drugs across the supply chain.  
- Enhanced monitoring of order volumes and outlier detection (e.g., excessive 90-day averages).  
- Tighter validation of wholesaler orders and customer blocks.  
- Clear auditability of exceptions, with penalties for non-compliance.  

These synthetic datasets allow stakeholders to **simulate how their systems will behave under the new rules**, test ML or rules-based anomaly detection, and explore workflows for handling compliance triggers without exposing real data.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This notebook provides a **realistic, self-contained playground** for exploring upcoming U.S. pharmaceutical compliance challenges. It generates structured synthetic data, validates it through rule-based checks, and enables users to experiment with automation or model-driven detection approaches‚Äîall without depending on real-world data sources.
