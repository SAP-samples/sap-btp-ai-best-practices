| project_title | Wintering bird surveys on the south bank of the Humber Estuary, Lincolnshire | MSH Commercial Kitchen Project |
| project_description | This project is a component of a wider project that will respond to the challenge of balancing the demand for development land and the need to safeguard terrestrial supporting habitat for SPA bird species. The prime objective is to provide all those engaged with strategic planning and development management with a robust evidence base to assist in assessing plans and projects which could impact on the protected sites, while ensuring that sufficient feeding and roosting resources are available to SPA bird populations. The aim of this project is to undertake systematic surveys, collecting species presence data suitable for use in Habitat Suitability Models for passage and wintering waders (namely curlew Numenius arquata, golden plover Pluvialis apricaria and lapwing Vanellus vanellus) within a 10 km buffer of the Humber Estuary SPA. This phase of the project will focus on the south bank of the Humber Estuary. | The works comprise the design, supply and installation (including mechanical and electrical connection) of commercial kitchen equipment. Appliances to include appropriate warranties. Any electrical installation works are to be signed off by associated compliance body. |
