This can happen if, for example, the shelf life of the product is shorter than the demand period. In this case, consider a change in the procurement schedule. •There are other constraints which are in conflict with the minimum service level for minimum stock and have a higher rank. In this case, changing the procurement schedule towards shorter demand periods can help to reduce the order quantities required to fulfil the minimum service level for minimum stock. The resulting lower order quantities are more likely to fulfil any conflicting maximum constraint.
