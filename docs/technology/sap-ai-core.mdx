It provides seamless integration with your SAP solutions. Any AI function can be easily realized using open-source frameworks. SAP AI Core supports full lifecycle management of AI scenarios. Access generative AI capabilities and prompt lifecycle management via the generative AI hub.

SAP AI Core allows you to make data-driven decisions confidently and efficiently and is tailored to business problems. It handles large volumes of data and provides scalable machine learning capabilities to automate tasks such as triage services for customer feedback or tickets and classification tasks. SAP AI Core comes with preconfigured SAP solutions, can be configured for open-source machine learning frameworks, can be used with Argo Workflow and KServe, and can be embedded into other applications.

## Documentation

- [SAP AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core?locale=en-US) (SAP Help)

## Setup
