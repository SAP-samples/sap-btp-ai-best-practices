### Food for Thought

Generative AI models can generate a concise summary of a given text.

### Example

A long thread of a product support customer issue is summarized for a customer service employee.

### Key Questions

- What processes and tasks produce or consume long text?
- Who needs to get a summary of those texts?
- How is the summary leveraged?

  ## Implementation
  Summarizing text can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, particularly a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes "Summarization of Text" as an AI functional capability.
  
  After you have access to a foundation model, you can use this learning journey to implement summarization:
