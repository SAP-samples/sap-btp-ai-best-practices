### Food for Thought

Generative AI models enable users to access analytics using a conversational user interface.

### Example

An application enables users to access structured and unstructured data using a conversational interface.

### Key Questions

- What data would users prefer to access through a conversational interface?
- Why specific groups of users prefer a conversational interface to access analytics rather than a point-and-click user interface?
- What types of analytical questions users would like to formulate in natural language?

<br />

<div className="section-with-background blue">
  ## Implementation
  To create a conversational user interface you can:

- add skills to SAP Joule leveraging SAP Joule Studio - this best practice is under construction
- create a custom BTP application that call a large language model and application APIs - see best practice below for plain foundation model access
