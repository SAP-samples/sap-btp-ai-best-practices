### Food for Thought

AI can automatically analyze code for potential bugs, style inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks, providing suggestions for improvement.

### Example

A healthcare software company could use AI code review to enforce strict data privacy and security compliance, ensuring that patient data is handled correctly and mitigating the risk of regulatory fines and reputational damage.

### Key Questions

- How might we ensure consistent code quality and adherence to best practices across our teams?
- How might we reduce the time spent on manual code reviews without compromising quality?
- Where could AI code review help us to enforce coding standards and improve code consistency?
- How might we use AI code review to empower developers to focus on higher-level tasks and innovation?
- How could AI code review help us to improve onboarding of new developers?
