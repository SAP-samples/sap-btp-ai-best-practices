### Food for Thought

Synthetic data generation" allows AI to create artificial datasets that mimic real-world data, enabling developers to test and train software without relying on potentially sensitive or unavailable actual data.

### Example

An e-commerce company could use synthetic data generation to create realistic customer purchase histories, including browsing patterns and demographic information, to test and refine their recommendation algorithms without accessing or compromising actual customer data.

### Key Questions

- What data limitations are currently hindering our ability to develop or test new solutions?
- Where do we face significant data privacy or security concerns that restrict data access?
- Which areas of our business struggle with data scarcity or imbalanced datasets?
- Where could faster iteration and testing be achieved by reducing reliance on acquiring real data?
- How could we use synthetic data to simulate and optimize complex processes or systems?
- Where can we create more diverse and representative datasets using synthetic data?
- What new products or services could we develop if we had access to unlimited, customizable data?
- How can synthetic data help us explore emerging markets or address future challenges?
- What new analytical capabilities can be unlocked by generating tailored synthetic datasets?

  ## Implementation
  Coding assistance can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, particularly a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes coding assistance as an AI functional capability.
