### Food for Thought

Agentic workflows enable AI systems to autonomously plan, execute, and adapt complex, multi-step tasks by reasoning, making decisions, and utilizing tools with minimal human intervention.

### Example

An AI agent, upon receiving an invoice complaint email, autonomously extracts relevant data (invoice number, customer details, disputed amount), cross-references it with the accounting system, identifies potential discrepancies (e.g., pricing errors, missing items), initiates a dialogue with the customer for clarification if needed, and either automatically resolves simple errors or generates a detailed case for a human agent, including a proposed resolution and supporting documentation, significantly reducing resolution time and improving customer satisfaction.

### Key Questions

- What multi-step, complex tasks in our organization are currently manual or inefficient?
- What processes require significant data gathering and analysis before action can be taken?
- What tasks involve coordinating multiple systems or data sources?
- What tasks require the ability to adapt to changing circumstances or unexpected events?
- Where can AI autonomously plan and execute a sequence of actions to achieve a specific goal?
- What tasks require the AI to use a suite of tools or access various resources to complete the workflow?
- How can an AI agent identify and escalate complex or exceptional cases to human operators?
- Where can AI provide human operators with detailed summaries and recommendations to expedite decision-making?
