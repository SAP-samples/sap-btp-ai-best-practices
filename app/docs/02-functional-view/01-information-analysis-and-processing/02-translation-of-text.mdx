### Food for Thought

Generative AI models can automatically translate text from one language to another

### Example

Translating a text field in an application from English to Spanish

### Key Questions

- What business processes and tasks need text translation?
- What languages are involved?
- Does translation need to be executed in real-time or translated text can be stored?

<br />

<div className="section-with-background blue">
  ## Implementation
  Translating text can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, in particular a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes “Translation of Text” as an AI functional capability.
