### Food for Thought

AI models can determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a given text.

### Example

Analyzing customer reviews of a product to gauge overall satisfaction.

### Key Questions

- What business processes and tasks require the determination of a sentiment expressed in textual information?
- How does the identified sentiment affect the next steps of the process?
- Whose sentiments are we interested in to improve our offerings, processes, and experiences?

  ## Implementation
Classifying can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, particularly a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes “Sentiment Analysis” as an AI functional capability.

After you have access to a foundation model, you can use this learning journey to implement summarization:
