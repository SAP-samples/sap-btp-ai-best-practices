  <h1>Vector RAG vs Graph RAG</h1>
</div>

### Description

This page contains information on the Pros and Cons of Vector RAG and Graph RAG. When choosing an approach, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in order to maintain a balance between the capabilities and complexity of implementing the technology.

### Pros and Cons of Vector RAG and Graph RAG

The choice of which technology to use depends on the domain and the task being solved. But the general approach is that Vector RAG is necessary when it is necessary to work with a clear description of the subject area and limit generative models to specific data structures and attribute values. This allows you to avoid hallucinations and make the process more manageable.

Graph RAG also enables the following capabilities that are not available in classical RAG:

- **Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration:** One of the most powerful applications of Graph RAG in enterprise settings is its ability to connect knowledge across traditionally siloed domains. For example, in SAP environments, Graph RAG can link financial data with supply chain information and customer relations, enabling holistic analysis that was previously impossible. This cross-domain integration supports more sophisticated business intelligence capabilities and decision support systems.

- **Temporal Knowledge Representation:** Modern enterprise systems often need to track how knowledge evolves over time. Graph RAG implementations can incorporate temporal dimensions into knowledge graphs, allowing users to query historical states, track changes, and analyze trends. This capability is particularly valuable for compliance reporting, audit trails, and predictive analytics.

- **Multimodal Knowledge Representation:** Advanced Graph RAG systems can extend beyond text to incorporate multimodal knowledge, including numeric data, images, and even procedural knowledge representing business processes. This enables more comprehensive knowledge representation and retrieval, supporting complex use cases like visual data analysis and process optimization.

Also worth noting are the new challenges that come with using Graph RAG:

- **Scalability issues:** As knowledge graphs grow in size and complexity, query performance can degrade without proper optimization strategies.

- **Integration with legacy systems:** Enterprises often face challenges integrating Graph RAG with existing legacy systems that were not designed with graph data models in mind.

- **Knowledge graph maintenance:** Ongoing maintenance and management processes are required to ensure the knowledge graph is accurate and up-to-date.

Therefore, it is necessary to weigh the benefits and costs when using this approach.
