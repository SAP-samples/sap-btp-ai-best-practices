### Description

SAP Build Work Zone provides a unified, role-based digital workspace on SAP BTP that aggregates content and applications from SAP, custom, and third-party systems. SAP AI Core’s Document Grounding service, part of the Generative AI Hub, uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground AI outputs in enterprise data, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy.
 
When integrated, Work Zone acts as a knowledge source for Document Grounding—allowing AI Core to access your business content directly from Work Zone. The Advanced Edition supports native AI and direct grounding integration through configuration, while the Standard Edition requires a custom client for API-based access.

## <span className="step-number">2</span> <span className="step-title">BTP Pre-requisites</span>

Below are the prerequisites for integrating SAP AI Core document grounding with SAP Work Zone:
- Grounding Management on AI Core
- Work Zone advanced edition tenant and access credentials (OAuth2 ClientID and Client Secret)
- Role - Work Zone Administrator

There are three types of roles in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition:
- Default roles that are assigned automatically during the onboarding process
- Local roles that are created manually to allow access to local apps
- Remote roles that are added from remote content providers.

### 3.1 Create an OAuth client for Document Grounding

In the Admin Console, go to **External Integrations** > **OAuth Clients**, and click **Add OAuth Client**.
- Name - provide a meaningful name such as "Document Grounding OAuth Client".
- Integration URL - provide any URL in the format of "https://www.yoururl.com. This is a mandatory field, however, the URL isn't validated so you can enter any URL.
 
**Important** - once the OAuth client is created, note down the values of the Key and Secret. <br />

### 3.2 Enable the document grounding feature

In the Admin Console, go to **Feature Enablement** > **Features**, and in the **Feature Management** section, enable the option **Enable document grounding integration**. Select the OAuth client that you created in the previous step and save your changes.

### 3.4 Create Generic Secret on AI Launchpad

Now on SAP AI Launchpad, Create a Generic Secret under SAP AI Core Administration.

The Generic Secret must have the following parameters in JSON format:

![OAuth Client Creation](@site/static/generative-ai/document-grounding-workzone/images/create-04.png)

**Sidenote** - Make sure to assign document-grounding and documentRepositoryType as Key and true, and WorkZone as value respectively while creating a Generic Secret.

### 3.5 Upload documents to Work Zone

Now on SAP Build Work Zone - Advanced edition application, create a new Workspace and upload a document that we need to use as an AI Source in the grounding service.

![OAuth Client Creation](@site/static/generative-ai/document-grounding-workzone/images/upload-01.png)

After uploading the document in the newly created Workspace, go to the **Administration console** > **Area and Workspace Configuration** > **Workspaces**. Click on Actions and Enable as AI Source against the newly created Workspace for document grounding.

![OAuth Client Creation](@site/static/generative-ai/document-grounding-workzone/images/upload-02.png)

### 3.6 Create Data Repository on Document Grounding

Now, create a Data Repository under Grounding Management.

![OAuth Client Creation](@site/static/generative-ai/document-grounding-workzone/images/upload-03.png)

Open the newly created **Data Repository Pipeline** within **Grounding Management** in **SAP AI Launchpad**. The documents previously uploaded to the new workspace in the **Work Zone application** will now be visible here. 

Note: It might take sometime for the documents to appear in the Data Repository Pipeline.
