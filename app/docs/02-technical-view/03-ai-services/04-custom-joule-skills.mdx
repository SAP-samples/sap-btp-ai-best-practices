### Description

Joule Skills is the approach to tailor Joule's unique capabilities to every specific business need. 

The supported way to extend Joule’s built-in capabilities is via Joule Studio (in SAP Build). It lets you define, build, deploy, monitor and improve your own specific workflows for Joule to follow. It also enables seamless and easy integration with APIs, both SAP and external, using the destinations in your BTP Subaccount and Build environment.

Joule Skills are a vital tool to improving and finetuning Joule to accelerate your business and solve problems with no-code, easy to deploy solution.

### Expected Outcome

When using Joule Studio to develop custom skills you can expect:

- Easy integration with SAP Systems and third-party APIs to extend base functionality
- Traceable version changes and transparency in deployment
- Workflow-level execution transparency
- Easy deployment
- Integration with SAP Build

<LoginWall>

### Benefits

- **No-code extension of functionality** - Joule Studio does not require any code to create a skill and give Joule more actions to perform
- **Integrated in SAP Build** - works in a familiar environment and allows for extension with RPA automations and workflows
- **Secure and compliant** - Joule runs within SAP Build/BTP environments, but skills may call external APIs via BTP Destinations; data flow should follow enterprise security and governance policies.
- **Integration made simple** - Joule Skills provides easy integration with SAP and third party APIs

### Key Concepts

Some key concepts are part of Build Process Automation and can be found ([here](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-process-automation/sap-build-process-automation-dev/using-sap-build-process-automation?state=DRAFT&version=Dev&locale=en-US)).

Here are the Joule Studio specific concepts:
- **Joule Skill** - a predefined workflow that gets executed by Joule based on the description given to it.
- **Joule Skill Project** - project type that can contain multiple individual skills
- **Input Parameters** - required parameters for the defined skill in order to execute properly
- **Output Parameters** - parameters that can be passed to another part of a workflow as a result after the skill is complete

## <span className="step-number">2</span> <span className="step-title">Pre-requisites</span>

### Commercial
- Joule Subscription
- SAP Build with build-default service plan
- License for an active developer user in SAP Build
- BTP Subaccount with active subscriptions to SAP Build Process Automation and SAP Cloud Identity Services

### Technical
1. Set up a SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) subaccount ([Setup Guide](/docs/technology/sap-business-technology-platform#setup-guide))
2. Set up SAP Build ([Setup Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-service/build-service-guide/initial-setup-of-sap-build?version=Cloud&locale=en-US))
3. Set up subscription to Cloud Identity Services ([Setup Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/initial-setup?locale=en-US&version=Cloud&q=Initial))
4. Set up Joule Studio ([Setup Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/Joule_Studio/45f9d2b8914b4f0ba731570ff9a85313/04b323352fa645238211ce017f634d34.html?locale=en-US#set-up-joule-studio-using-the-booster))

## <span className="step-number">3</span> <span className="step-title">Key Choices and Guidelines</span>

### Joule Skills Development 

- Be very clear and descriptive when writing the Joule Skill Description as it is used to determine if this skill is needed for the task at hand.
- Each skill should be a self-contained function that fulfils one specific task in order to minimize confusion, improve performance and supportability.
- It is not advisable to give Skills the ability to delete or modify critical data without consulting a human first.
- When creating multiple skills in a project, make sure to follow consistency in naming and ensure they do not overlap in function and description. Also bundle them based on common or complimentary functionality
- The deployment of Joule skills project should be done in the custom environment that can be shared with authorized users or user groups.
- When the 'Allow Joule to generate a response' option is disabled, ensure that a suitable custom message (via Send Message) is configured for every possible output of the action component
- Carefully designate mandatory input and output fields in the Joule skill based on the use case. Joule will not execute the action component until all required fields are captured from the user's prompt. If only some mandatory fields are provided, Joule will continue prompting the user to supply the remaining ones before proceeding
- Apply conditions to action outputs such as verifying that a list contains at least one object before triggering downstream steps. This helps ensure logical flow and prevents unnecessary errors
- For actions using the 'GET' method in Joule skills, it's recommended to apply precise filters to narrow the search scope and avoid API timeout issues
- Joule skill inputs are always treated as text (string data type). To ensure compatibility with downstream action components, convert these inputs to the appropriate data types using functions like StringToNumber(skill-input).
- Use meaningful parameter descriptions instead of abbreviated or encoded labels. This helps Joule better interpret the context during skill execution. For example, use ‘location’ instead of ‘loc’.
- If Joule fails to respond after a prompt, use the debug mode in Joule Studio to test skill interactions. Additionally, check the ‘Request Logs’ view to confirm whether the correct skill was triggered.

### Joule Skills Interactions

Provide clear, specific, and actionable prompts when interacting with Joule. The more precise your input, the better Joule can interpret and execute the intended skill. Here are a few illustrative examples:

<div align="center">
---

*Update the tax code in all the line items of the purchase order ‘123456’ with ‘I1’. Please confirm the update is successful after you complete the task.*

---

---

*Create a sales order using customer PO ‘123456’ for ‘Material1’ with a quantity of 10 PCs.*

---
</div>

**You may also take an approach with multi-line prompts as:**

<div align="center">
---

*Identify purchase order ‘123456’.*  
*Update the tax code to I1 on all purchase order line items.*  
*Generate a summary confirming the update and state any issues encountered.*

---

---

*The sales order should reference the customer's purchase order number 123456.*  
*Include ‘Material1’ in the sales order line item with a quantity of 10 PCs.*

---
</div>

### Joule Skills Limitations

- The deployment of Joule skills to an environment in the build tenant may require up to 5 minutes to 30 minutes to complete.
- The Field Map function cannot directly map a list of objects (output from an action component) to downstream build components like RPA automation artifacts. As a workaround, you can pass the entire list as a generic object (data type ‘Any’). While this won't trigger errors during project save or release, deployment of the Joule skill may result in errors.
- Joule skills can invoke published automations and processes from SAP Build Process Automation. However, the reverse i.e. calling Joule skills from SAP Build Process Automation is not supported.
- Automations and processes triggered from SAP Build Process Automation within Joule skills are asynchronous. Therefore, their outputs cannot be used as part of the ongoing user conversation in Joule.
- If permissions are modified in a shared environment, any deployed projects must be redeployed for the changes to take effect.
