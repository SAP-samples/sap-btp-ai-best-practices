### Description

Classification is a fundamental machine learning technique aimed at organizing input data into distinct classes. During the classification process, the model undergoes training using the 'train subset' function, followed by evaluation using the 'test subset' function. A notable distinction between classification and regression tasks lies in their output variables. While classification deals with discrete target variables, regression tasks involve continuous output variables.

### Expected Outcome

Essentially, the expected outcome is to recognize patterns in the training data, and use these patterns to classify new data into one of the pre-defined classes. 

#### Scenarios

Classification can be utilized in various scenarios, such as spam detection, image recognition, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, among others. For example, the figure below illustrates how a classification model determines whether an incoming message falls under the category of SPAM or Inbox (non-SPAM).

- SAP BTP Applications can embed use of PAL or APL functions as part of standard SQLScript design-time artifacts, e.g. multi-target or full-stack CAP applications. Furthermore, usage of PAL and APL functions may also be utilized via applications leveraging Python runtimes and scripts using the Python Machine Learning client (hana-ml).


## <span className="step-number">3</span> <span className="step-title">Key Choices and Guidelines</span>

Classification is a fundamental technique in machine learning used to categorize data points into predefined labels based on their features. It plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, such as predicting whether an employee will churn or remain in a company. The core principles of classification involve supervised learning, where models are trained using labeled data to recognize patterns and make predictions on new, unseen data.

There are different approaches to classification, each employing distinct methodologies. Some of the most commonly used algorithms include decision trees, gradient boosting, and neural networks, each suited to different types of data and classification challenges. Classification itself can be categorized into three main types. 

- **Binary** classification involves distinguishing between two possible outcomes, such as "yes" or "no" and "spam" or "not spam."  
- **Multi-class** classification extends binary classification by categorizing data into multiple distinct groups, such as classifying different product categories.  
- **Multi-label** classification allows a single data point to belong to multiple categories, such as tagging a document with multiple relevant topics. Or multi-target classification, where a single model shall be used to predict multiple target labels using a single model.

Handling of text data and moreover text embeddings as features has emerged as crucial capability for many classification scenarios, as only by the use of text embedding models the semantic understanding of input text could be captured by classification algorithms. The following [link](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-ml-samples/blob/main/Python-API/pal/notebooks/24QRC04_2.23-unlocking_text_data.ipynb) shows an example.

### Algorithm Selection  
With the great variety of algorithms, the classification scenario type as well as data patterns like number of rows (observations), number of features / type of features and cardinality of features influence the selection of classification models and their use cases.

| Dataset Size | Algorithm | Description |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Small to Medium size data sets** | Logistic Regression | Used in simple binary classification problems, such as predicting "yes" or "no" labels. |
|  | k – Nearest Neighbors (k – NN) |  |
|  | Decision Trees | Used in cases for easy model interpretability and model explainability. |

| Dataset Size | Algorithm | Description |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Medium to Large data sets** | Random Forest | Used for complex classification problems where accuracy is highly relevant. |
|  | Support Vector Machines (SVM) | Used for classification scenarios with clear margin of separation, e.g., image classification. |
|  | XGBoost | Used in high performance classification problems, e.g., fraud detection. |
|  | Neural Networks | Also known as Deep Learning, it is used for complex and high dimensional data scenarios, e.g., speech recognition. |
|  | LightGBM | Used for large scale and high performance applications, e.g., web search ranking. |
|  | Multinomial Naive Bayes | Used for discrete data, specially for text classification tasks where word counts are used as features for sentiment analysis. |


| Dataset Size | Algorithm | Description |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Very Large data sets** | Deep Learning, i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture for images, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequence data. | Used for very large and complex datasets, e.g., natural language processing. |
|  | Distributed Machine Learning Frameworks such as Spark MLLib, TensorFlow. | Used for scalable machine learning scenarios across distributed computing environments, e.g., large scale recommendation systems. |

### Algorithm experimentation and selection
AutoML frameworks like [SAP HANA Cloud PAL’s AutoML](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-predictive-analysis-library/automl-automl) implementation greatly help users in probing multiple algorithms and parameter variations for a given scenario for selecting the best possible algorithm and model. In the following [link](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-ml-samples/blob/main/Python-API/usecase-examples/sapcommunity-automl-examples/Example%20-%20Using%20PAL%20AutoML%20for%20Classification.ipynb) you can view an example on how to apply it.

### Data Preparation and Model Evaluation
The success of any machine learning model is fundamentally dependent on two core processes: rigorous data preparation and comprehensive model evaluation. These steps ensure the data is clean and relevant and that the model's performance is accurately measured against the right metrics.  
For a detailed guide on the methodologies, key metrics, and best practices for preparing your data and evaluating model performance across different ML tasks, please refer to our unified [ML Data Preparation and Model Evaluation Best Practices](/docs/technical-view/narrow-ai/data-preparation-and-model-evaluation) page.

### Leverage In-Database ML functions from SAP HANA whenever possible
- **Prioritize HANA ML:** If your data resides in SAP HANA (Cloud/on-premise) or SAP Datasphere, using hana-ml is generally the most efficient approach due to minimized data movement and optimized performance.

### Anomaly and Outlier Detection
Identifying anomalies or outliers is a critical aspect of building robust machine learning models. These unusual data points can represent data quality issues, unique real-world events, or errors in data collection that might otherwise skew model training and evaluation.  
For a comprehensive guide on the methodologies and best practices for discovering anomalies in your data, please refer to our unified [Anomaly Detection Best Practices](/docs/technical-view/narrow-ai/anomaly-detection) page.

## <span className="step-number">4</span> <span className="step-title">Implementation</span>

When developing regression models with SAP tools and libraries, the choice of your application's runtime dictates the relevant information. Different approaches can be used to embed the classification scenario artifacts.

### Programming Model Selection Guidelines
When developing linear regression scenarios with SAP HANA’s Predictive Analysis Library (PAL), consider the following guidelines:

- **Recommended Approach (Data Science Workflows):** Utilize the Python hana-ml library for a streamlined, intuitive experience aligned with standard data science practices, including convenient data manipulation and integration with machine learning workflows. This approach yields best productivity during ML model experimentation until the final model of choice and parameterization has been determined.
- **Alternative Approaches:**
  - SQLScript database procedures and table functions are the typical HANA design-time artifacts for embedding and invoking PAL and APL procedures into BTP CAP or XSA full-stack applications. Artifact generations from the hana-ml machine learning client in Python is supported.

The final choice should align with your team’s expertise and project requirements.
