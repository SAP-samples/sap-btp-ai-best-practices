### Food for Thought

Through code generation AI can automatically produce functional code snippets or entire programs based on natural language descriptions or existing code patterns, streamlining the development process.

### Example

A company could use code generation to quickly create boilerplate code for data access layers in a new microservice, enabling developers to focus on business logic rather than repetitive setup.

### Key Questions

- What processes could be significantly accelerated by automating code creation?
- Which areas of our codebase are difficult to maintain or modify due to their complexity?
- How can we use code generation to empower non-programmers to create simple applications or automations?
- How can code generation help us to democratize access to software development?

  ## Implementation
  Coding assistance can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, particularly a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes coding assistance as an AI functional capability.
