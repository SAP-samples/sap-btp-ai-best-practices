### Food for Thought

AI can automatically create sets of instructions and example scenarios to check if a program works correctly.

### Example

To validate a chatbot's ability to handle customer inquiries, the AI generates test cases that simulate various common questions and verifies the chatbot's responses for accuracy and relevance, enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Key Questions

- What are the critical failure points in our existing processes or systems that could be automatically tested?
- Where are we currently spending significant manual effort on quality assurance that could be automated?
- How can we use automated testing to accelerate our development cycles and reduce time-to-market?
- How can we create test cases that adapt to evolving requirements and system changes?

  ## Implementation
  Coding assistance can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, particularly a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes coding assistance as an AI functional capability.
