### Food for Thought

AI can automatically generate human-readable explanations and documentation for code, improving understanding and maintainability.

### Example

An internal IT department in a large corporation could use AI to automatically document their internal scripts and automation processes, reducing the reliance on specific individuals and ensuring business continuity during employee turnover.

### Key Questions

- Where do we struggle most with maintaining up-to-date and accurate code documentation?
- How much time do our developers spend manually writing or updating documentation?
- How might we leverage AI documentation to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration within our development teams?
- How might we use AI to create more accessible and user-friendly documentation for non-technical stakeholders?

  ## Implementation
  Coding assistance can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, particularly a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes coding assistance as an AI functional capability.
