  <h1>Recommendations based on Historical Data</h1>

### Food for Thought

AI systems can analyze past patterns and trends to predict or suggest future actions or preferences.

### Example

An AI application analyzes past sales data to recommend which leads sales teams should focus on for higher conversion rates.

### Key Questions

- What historical data is available and relevant to the desired outcome?
- What patterns or trends within this data can be identified and analyzed?
- What specific actions or preferences are we trying to predict or recommend?
- How can the AI's recommendations be presented in a useful and actionable way?
