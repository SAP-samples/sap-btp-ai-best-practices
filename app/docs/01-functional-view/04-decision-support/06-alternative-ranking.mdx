### Food for Thought

Alternative ranking, as an AI capability, allows for the prioritization of items or information based on diverse criteria beyond traditional relevance, such as user preferences or dynamic contextual factors.

### Example

A customer service platform utilizes AI to rank support tickets based on urgency, customer sentiment, and agent expertise, ensuring critical issues are addressed promptly and efficiently.

### Key Questions

- How can we optimize resource allocation by ranking tasks, projects, or leads based on their potential impact or urgency
- How can we mitigate risks by ranking potential threats or anomalies based on their likelihood and severity?
- How can we improve efficiency by prioritizing workflows or processes based on predicted bottlenecks or dependencies?
- How can we drive revenue by ranking products, services, or offers based on their predicted conversion rates or customer lifetime value?
- How can we improve decision making by ranking available information based on relevance and importance to the given situation?
