  <h1>Generate Text based on Generic Knowledge</h1>

### Food for Thought

AI foundational models can generate text for different purposes (writing articles, suggesting ideas or questions for a defined topic, etc.) based on public knowledge that was available until the model was trained.

### Example

An application can suggest questions around a defined topic.

### Key Questions

- What text needs to be generated without looking at any specific, company internal information?
- Are those text based on generic knowledge or is real-time, updated information required?

  ## Implementation
  To implement this AI capability, leverage plain direct access to a foundation model, formulating an appropriate prompt.
