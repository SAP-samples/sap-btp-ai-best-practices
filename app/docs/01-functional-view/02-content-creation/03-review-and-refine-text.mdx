### Food for Thought

Generative AI models can review and refine text

### Example

A BTP application helps reviewing text of email messages to be sent from a customer service center.

### Key Questions

- What business processes require text to be reviewed and refined?
- What content needs to be reviewed or refined?
- What type of review or refinement is required?

<br />

<div className="section-with-background blue">
  ## Implementation
  Reviewing and refining text can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, particularly a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes “Reviewing and Refining Text” as an AI functional capability.
