### Food for Thought

Generative AI models can describe an image.

### Example

A BTP application helps generate a textual description from the picture of a technical component.

### Key Questions

- What business processes require images to be described?
- What types of images are needed?
- How is the generated description used in a business process?

<div className="section-with-background blue">
  ## Implementation
  Describing images can be achieved calling a foundation model, particularly a multi-modal model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes “Describe images” as an AI functional capability.
