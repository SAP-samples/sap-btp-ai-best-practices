### Food for Thought

SAP Translation Hub is the official AI Translation Solution for SAP. 

Generative AI models can automatically translate text from one language to another. These models can even create and process multilingual content (for example, summarize text) all in one go, without the need for a translation step.

### Examples

- Translating a text field in an application from English to Spanish or Japanese.
- Processing content from sources in French, German, and Portuguese and creating a summary in English in a pre-defined format.

### Key Questions

- What business processes and tasks need text translation?
- What languages are involved?
- Does translation need to be executed in real-time or translated text can be stored?

  ## Implementation

[SAP Translation Hub](https://help.sap.com/docs/translation-hub/sap-translation-hub/what-is-sap-translation-hub?version=Cloud) enables you to efficiently translate custom applications, extensions, documentation, and more into a wide scope of languages. SAP Translation Hub is the central translation service behind the Translation Module in AI core (see [Input Translation](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/input-translation?locale=en-US) and [Output Translation](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/output-translation?locale=en-US)). Visit the [SAP Translation Hub Best Practice](/docs/technical-view/ai-services/sap-translation-hub) for detailed guidelines on how to use SAP Translation Hub. Contact [SAP Translation Hub](mailto:translationhub@sap.com) to discuss your use case.

Creating multilingual content can sometimes be the best option for your AI application. It can be also achieved with a prompt of direct call to a large language model. Visit the [Access to Generative AI models Best Practice](/docs/technical-view/generative-ai/plain/access-to-generative-ai-models) to find how to access a large language model in SAP BTP.
