### Food for Thought

Generative AI models can automatically translate text from one language to another

### Example

Translating a text field in an application from English to Spanish

### Key Questions

- What business processes and tasks need text translation?
- What languages are involved?
- Does translation need to be executed in real-time or translated text can be stored?

  ## Implementation
  Translating text can be achieved with a prompt on a foundation model, in particular a large language model. Here you find how to access a foundation model in SAP BTP to implement a use-case that includes “Translation of Text” as an AI functional capability.

[SAP Translation Hub](https://help.sap.com/docs/translation-hub/sap-translation-hub/what-is-sap-translation-hub?version=Cloud) enables you to efficiently translate custom applications, extensions, documentation, and more into a wide scope of languages. SAP Translation Hub is the central translation service behind the Translation Module in AI core (see [Input Translation](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/input-translation?locale=en-US) and [Output Translation](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/output-translation?locale=en-US)).
