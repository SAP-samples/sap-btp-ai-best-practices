  <h1>Question & Answers on Enterprise Knowledge Base</h1>

### Food for Thought

AI allows to query proprietary and private data, both unstructured and structured data, using natural language. 

### Examples

- IT function of a company can offer a chatbot to answer questions about IT policies based on multiple documents and databases
- An e-commerce company can offer a customer self-service to answer questions like “why has not my order shipped yet” by retriving information from different systems and creating an answer through AI 
- Create an informational report by combining information from multiple internal data sources

### Key Questions

- What internal enterprise information is more convenient to be queried using natural language?
- Is that information structured (e.g. data records in a database or application) or unstructured (e.g. pdf documents)?
- What business processes would benefit from querying proprietary information in natural language?
- Who (which roles) would benefit from querying proprietary information in natural language?
