### Food for Thought

AI models can sort information into categories.

### Example

Customer service tickets or news are classified depending on the topic.

### Key Questions

What information do you need to classify?

- What information do you need to classify? 
- Are the categories/types already existing or to be automatically defined?
- What business processes can leverage this categorization of information?
- What personas can benefit from this categorization of information?

  ## Implementation
  To implement this AI capability, you can use either generative AI (foundation) models or classic Machine Learning models. For unstructured text data Large Language Models are powerful for tasks requiring nuanced language understanding. Classic Machine Learning models excel with structured data, when interpretability is crucial.
