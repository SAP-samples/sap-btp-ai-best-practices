### Food for Thought

AI models can recognize and label objects within an image, detect anomalies in an image, and provide descriptions of pictures. 

### Example

Identifying products in photos for online shopping.

### Key Questions

- Where can we use AI to automatically identify and track specific objects?
- How can we use AI to accurately divide an image into meaningful parts?
- How can we use AI to understand the context of a scene and make informed decisions?
- What if we could extract detailed information from visual data without human intervention?
- How could we use AI to make visual information more accessible?
- What if we could use images to predict...?" (e.g., potential failures, upcoming trends, changes in behavior)
