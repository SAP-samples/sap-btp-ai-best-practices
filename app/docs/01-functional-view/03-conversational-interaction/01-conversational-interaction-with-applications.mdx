### Food for Thought

Generative AI models enable users to access applications using a conversational user interface.

### Example

SAP co-pilot Joule can be extended to access specific application functionalities.

### Key Questions

- What business processes require conversational interfaces?
- What types of functionalities are appropriate for conversational access?
- Is a conversational user interface appropriate to navigate application functionalities?
- Is a conversational user interface appropriate to retrieve master data?
- Is a conversational user interface appropriate to retrieve transactional data?

<br />

<div className="section-with-background blue">
  ## Implementation
  To create a conversational user interface you can:

- add skills to SAP Joule leveraging SAP Joule Studio - this best practice is under construction
- create a custom BTP application that call a large language model and application APIs - see best practice below for plain foundation model access
