# About

SAP BTP AI Best Practices is a curated collection of proven development guidelines and patterns to develop AI-powered BTP-based applications.

In this context, an AI use-case leverages one or more AI capabilities, which describe what AI functionally does (e.g. summarizing text, identify an anomaly, etc.). With this in mind, we designed the functional view of this site as a catalogue of functional patterns that recur in AI use-cases. They have a description, an examples, and few questions you can use to generate use-case ideas.  

Then the use-case needs to be implemented on BTP (a standalone app, a extension, an analytics, etc.).

Here is a list of the SAP BTP AI Best Practices we have released so far (watch the related teaser videos for a short introduction):
- [Access to Generative AI Models](/docs/technical-view/generative-ai/plain/access-to-generative-ai-models)
- [Prompt Templating](/docs/technical-view/generative-ai/plain/prompt-templating)
- [Data Masking](/docs/technical-view/generative-ai/plain/data-masking)
- [Content Filtering](/docs/technical-view/generative-ai/plain/content-filtering)
- [Vector-based Retrieval Augmented Generation embedding](/docs/technical-view/generative-ai/rag/vector-rag-embedding)
- [Vector-based Retrieval Augmented Generation Query Pipeline](/docs/technical-view/generative-ai/rag/vector-rag-query-pipeline)

You can give us feedback [here](btp_ai_bp@sap.com)

Further Best Practices are in preparation. Stay tuned!
