# About

SAP BTP AI Best Practices is a curated collection of proven development guidelines and patterns designed to **empower you to build cutting-edge, AI-powered applications on SAP BTP**. We aim to help you accelerate your development, reduce complexity, and unlock new possibilities with artificial intelligence.

An AI use case leverages one or more **AI capabilities**, which describe what AI functionally does (e.g., summarizing text, identifying an anomaly). With this in mind, we have designed the functional view of this site as a catalogue of **functional patterns** that frequently recur in AI use cases. Each pattern comes with a clear description, practical examples, and thought-provoking questions you can use to **spark new use-case ideas** related to that specific capability.

Defined AI use cases are then implemented as SAP BTP applications (whether a standalone application, an extension, or an analytics solution). We offer **a direct connection** from the AI capabilities to implementation guidelines, leveraging one or more Best Practices to ensure your solutions are robust and efficient.

You can also directly access the technical view, which organizes Best Practices based on different **AI domains** (such as generative AI or narrow ML) and links them back to the possible capabilities they can implement. This view helps you understand the underlying technology and how it can be applied to **solve real-world business challenges**.

Here's a list of the SAP BTP AI Best Practices we have released so far, designed to help you get started quickly (watch the related teaser videos for a short introduction):
