# SAP BTP AI Best Practice Demo - Prompt Templating - CAP (full stack)

This project demonstrates best practices for accessing generative AI models through a CAP (Cloud Application Programming model) application using the SAP Cloud SDK for AI. It provides examples of how to interact with language models to obtain responses based on user prompts within a CAP service context.

## Prerequisites

- SAP Business Technology Platform account
- Access to SAP AI Core service
- Node.js LTS version
- Cloud Foundry CLI

## Configuration

The application requires proper configuration to connect to the SAP AI Core service. This is handled through CDS bindings in both local and remote deployments.

```

## Local Deployment

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

2. Login using `cf login -a API_ENDPOINT -o ORG -s SPACE`.

3. Bind the application to your AI Core instance:

   ```bash
   cds bind -2 AI_CORE_INSTANCE_NAME:AI_CORE_INSTANCE_SERVICE_KEY_NAME
   ```

4. Start the backend with AI Core binding:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

5. In a separate terminal, start the UI5 application:

   ```bash
   npm run start:ui5
   ```

   The UI5 application will automatically connect to the running CAP backend.

## Remote Deployment

> [!WARNING]  
> All CDS services are marked with `@requires: 'any'` and are publicly accessible in order to simplify the deployment process.
> Apply proper authentication mechanisms to avoid unauthorized access.

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. In the `mta.yml`, under the `resources` section on the `best-practices-aicore`, modify the `service-name` from `best-practices-aicore` to the name of your AI Core Service instance.
3. Transpile the CAP application using `npm run build`.
4. Login using `cf login -a API_ENDPOINT -o ORG -s SPACE`
5. Deploy the application using `npm run deploy`
6. Open URL of the `ai-prompt-templating-cap-fullstack-demo` in the browser to access the application.

## Usage

For local deployment, the backend services are available at `http://localhost:4004` and the UI5 application at `http://localhost:8080`.

For remote deployment, access the application at the url returned during the deployment or found in the BTP cockpit.
