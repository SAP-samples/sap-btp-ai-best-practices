# SAP BTP AI Best Practice Demo - Prompt Templating - CAP (backend)

This project demonstrates best practices for accessing generative AI models through a CAP (Cloud Application Programming model) application using the SAP Cloud SDK for AI. It provides examples of how to interact with language models to obtain responses based on user prompts within a CAP service context.

## Prerequisites

- SAP Business Technology Platform account
- Access to SAP AI Core service
- Node.js LTS version
- Cloud Foundry CLI

## Configuration

The application requires proper configuration to connect to the SAP AI Core service. This is handled through CDS bindings in both local and remote deployments.

```

## Local Deployment

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

2. Login using `cf login -a API_ENDPOINT -o ORG -s SPACE`.

3. Bind the application to your AI Core instance:

   ```bash
   cds bind -2 AI_CORE_INSTANCE_NAME:AI_CORE_INSTANCE_SERVICE_KEY_NAME
   ```

4. Run the application with the binding:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

## Remote Deployment

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. In the `mta.yml`, under the `resources` section on the `best-practices-aicore`, modify the `service-name` from `best-practices-aicore` to the name of your AI Core Service instance.
3. Transpile the CAP application using `npm run build`.
4. Login using `cf login -a API_ENDPOINT -o ORG -s SPACE`.
5. Deploy the application using `npm run deploy`.

## Usage

For local deployment, set `SAMPLE_CAP_HOST` as `http://localhost:4004`. For remote deployment, set `SAMPLE_CAP_HOST` as the value returned from the deployment step.
