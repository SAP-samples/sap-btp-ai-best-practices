In this test, the food sample is mixed with Sudan III stain; lipids will absorb the stain and exhibit a distinct reddish-orange color. Alternatively, quantitative methods such as Soxhlet extraction can be used to measure the precise quantity of fat present in a food sample. This method involves extracting fat with a solvent and then measuring the extracted amount. Each methodology varies in its precision, complexity, and equipment requirements, depending on whether qualitative or quantitative results are desired.\n"
