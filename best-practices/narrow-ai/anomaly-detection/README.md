# Best Practices for Predictive AI - Anomaly Detection

This section delivers demo scenarios for detecting anomalies and outliers in various types of data including general tabular data and time series data. Multiple anomaly detection techniques are illustrated during the execution of the Machine Learning workflow.

Overall, the following tasks take place:

- Configuring the **Python machine learning client for SAP HANA (hana-ml)** and connecting to **SAP HANA Cloud**
- Accessing and visually exploring SAP HANA data using **HANA dataframes** in Python
- Training various **anomaly detection models** including Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, One-Class SVM, and K-means clustering using **hana-ml Predictive Analysis Library** (PAL) functions
- Implementing **time series anomaly detection** with specialized algorithms for temporal data
- Performing **Model Evaluation** to assess the effectiveness of anomaly detection

## Language-Specific Examples

This repository includes examples in multiple programming languages to demonstrate these best practices:

- [Python](./python/): Python implementation for developing anomaly detection models with SAP hana-ml

## Getting Started

Each language-specific folder contains its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions. Choose the implementation that best matches your technology stack to get started.
