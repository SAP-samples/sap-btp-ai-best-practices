# Best Practices for Predictive AI - Clustering

This section delivers a demo scenario to group iris flowers into clusters based on their feature measurements **[1]**. The Clustering technique is illustrated during the execution of the Machine Learning workflow.

Overall, the following tasks take place:

- Configuring the **Python machine learning client for SAP HANA (hana-ml)** and connecting to **SAP HANA Cloud**
- Accessing and visually exploring SAP HANA data using **HANA dataframes** in Python
- Training a **KMeans model** for the iris dataset using **hana-ml Predictive Analysis Library** (PAL) functions
- Explore the  **forecasted result** in a graphical report

## Language-Specific Examples

This repository includes examples in multiple programming languages to demonstrate these best practices:

- [Python](./python/): Python implementation for developing Clustering models with SAP hana-ml

## Getting Started

Each language-specific folder contains its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions. Choose the implementation that best matches your technology stack to get started.
