# Best Practices for Predictive AI - Linear Regression

This section delivers a demo scenario for Predicting housing prices for the state of California **[1]**. The Linear Regression technique is illustrated during the execution of the Machine Learning workflow.

Overall, the following tasks take place:

- Configuring the **Python machine learning client for SAP HANA (hana-ml)** and connecting to **SAP HANA Cloud**
- Accessing and visually exploring SAP HANA data using **HANA dataframes** in Python
- Training a **regression model** for the housing prices using **hana-ml Predictive Analysis Library** (PAL) functions
- Performing **Model Evaluation** to show the model accuracy obtained
