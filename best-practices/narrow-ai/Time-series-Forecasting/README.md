# Best Practices for Predictive AI - Time Series Forecasting

This section delivers a demo scenario for Predicting overnight stay for future months **[1]**. The Time Series Forecasting technique is illustrated during the execution of the Machine Learning workflow.

Overall, the following tasks take place:

- Configuring the **Python machine learning client for SAP HANA (hana-ml)** and connecting to **SAP HANA Cloud**
- Accessing and visually exploring SAP HANA data using **HANA dataframes** in Python
- Training a **time series Forecasting model** for the overnight stay using **hana-ml Predictive Analysis Library** (PAL) functions
- Explore the  **forecasted result** in a graphical report
