# Best Practices for Predictive AI - Classification

This section delivers a demo scenario for preventing employee churn, which has been the focus of the very first SAP HANA Cloud Machine Learning Challenge **[1]**. The Classification technique is illustrated during the execution of the Machine Learning workflow.

Overall, the following tasks take place:

* Configuring the **Python machine learning client for SAP HANA (hana-ml)** and connecting to **SAP HANA Cloud**.
* Accessing and visually exploring SAP HANA data using **HANA dataframes** in Python.
* Training a **classification model** for preventing employee churn using **hana-ml Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) functions**.
* Performing **Model Evaluation** to show the model accuracy obtained.
