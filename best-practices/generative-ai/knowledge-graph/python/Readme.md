# Knowledge Graph RAG â€“ Python Implementation

This folder contains the **Python-based implementation** of best practices for building and querying **Knowledge Graphs for RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) on SAP BTP.

These examples demonstrate how to extract RDF triplets from raw text using prompt engineering and visualize structured knowledge for grounding LLM responses.

## Project Structure
```
knowledge-graph/
â””â”€â”€ python/
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts.py # Prompt templates for KG creation and selective filtering
â”œâ”€â”€ KG-RDF-creation-grounding-visualisation-BP07-BP08-BestPractice.ipynb # End-to-end example
â””â”€â”€ README.md # Project documentation (this file)
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```


## Included Content

- âœ… **Prompt Engineering Templates**  
  `prompts.py` defines reusable LangChain prompt templates for RDF triplet extraction â€” you can update it for your domain.

- ðŸ“Š **Notebook Demo**  
  `KG-RDF-creation-grounding-visualisation-BP07-BP08-BestPractice.ipynb` demonstrates:
  - Extracting entities and relationships
  - Filtering by allowed attributes
  - Creating RDF graphs from plain text
  - Upload KG to HANA DB
  - Using som attributes for searching in a new document
  - Visualizing the result using Python tooling

## Data Samples

You can use PDF documents as domain data sources for knowledge graph creation. Here are a couple of examples:
> - [EBMUD 2312 - Four 1500-HP Main Air Compressor Motors (PDF)](https://www.ebmud.com/application/files/3416/7771/2399/2312_-_Four_1500-HP_Main_Air_Compressor_Motors_FINAL.pdf)
> - [RS Components A700000006779737 (PDF)](https://docs.rs-online.com/d853/A700000006779737.pdf)


Feel free to use your own PDF documents in the repository to experiment with KG extraction and grounding.


## Use Case

This implementation supports the BTP AI Best Practices themes:
- **KG RAG â€“ Overall and KG Creation**
- **KG RAG â€“ Query Pipeline** 

> For full pipeline integration and execution, see the parent folder's `README.md`.

## Audience

This example is built for:
- SAP HANA Cloud KG Engine developers
- AI Core pipeline designers
- Anyone building AI-grounded applications using structured semantic data
