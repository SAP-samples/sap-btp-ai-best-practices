## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a BTP subaccount and an AI Core service instance created. See the [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md) section for detailed instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with a specific best practice:

1. Navigate to the relevant subdirectory
2. Read the README.md file for an overview and instructions
3. Explore the example implementations in your preferred programming language
4. Follow the setup instructions to run the examples in your own environment

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to these best practices:

1. Ensure your contribution follows the established patterns
2. Include documentation explaining the purpose and implementation details
3. Provide examples in at least one programming language
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your contribution
