# AI Model Access Demo (Python)

This project demonstrates best practices for accessing generative AI models using the SAP GenAI Hub. It provides examples of how to interact with various language models to obtain responses based on user prompts.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-btp-ai-best-practices/
   cd sap-btp-ai-best-practices/best-practices/access-to-generative-ai-models/python
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Populate the `.env` file with the required values.

5. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open the `langchain_implementation.ipynb`, `native_implementation.ipynb`, or `orchestration_implementation.ipynb` notebook in your browser, depending on the implementation you wish to explore.


## Usage Examples

The notebooks demonstrate various methods to call LLMs through SAP GenAI Hub:

- **Native Client Integrations (`native_implementation.ipynb`):**
  - Amazon and Anthropic Models
  - OpenAI Models
- **LangChain Implementations (`langchain_implementation.ipynb`):**
  - OpenAI Models
  - Amazon and Anthropic Models
  - Google Vertex AI Models
- **Orchestration Implementation (`orchestration_implementation.ipynb`):**
  - Unified method to call any model from SAP GenAI Hub

Each section in the notebook provides a detailed example of how to set up and interact with the models.

### Recommended Method

The recommended method for accessing generative AI models depends on the use case:
- **For quick calls to LLMs:** Use the `native_implementation.ipynb`.
- **If using in conjunction with other LangChain functions or modules:** Use the `langchain_implementation.ipynb`.
- **For integration with other GenAI Hub Modules:** Use the `orchestration_implementation.ipynb`.
