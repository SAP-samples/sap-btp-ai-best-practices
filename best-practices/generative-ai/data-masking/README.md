# Best Practices for Data Masking

This section provides guidance and examples for data masking. Data masking is a crucial technique used to protect sensitive information when interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). It involves replacing identifiable or confidential data within prompts with placeholder text, ensuring that such information is not exposed to third-party models. This approach is particularly important for safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive details.\

## Language-Specific Examples

This repository includes examples in multiple programming languages to demonstrate these best practices:

- [TypeScript](./typescript/): A Node.js application using the SAP AI SDK for TypeScript
- [Python](./python/): Python implementation for accessing AI models
- [Java](./java/): Java examples for enterprise applications
- [CAP](./cap/): Cloud Application Programming model examples

## Getting Started

Each language-specific folder contains its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions. Choose the implementation that best matches your technology stack to get started.
