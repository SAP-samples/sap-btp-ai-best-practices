## Overview

**Knowledge Graphâ€“powered RAG** combines structured data representation with generative AI. This approach ensures:
- Better context grounding
- Semantic consistency
- Explainability of AI responses

This repository focuses on two key areas:
- ðŸ§± **KG Creation and Grounding** â€” extracting RDF triplets from domain documents using prompt templates with HANA Cloud and AI CORE
- ðŸ”Ž **Query Pipeline** â€” retrieving grounded facts from a KG and injecting them into prompts for LLMs

## Language Support

Currently, the examples are implemented in:

- [Python](./python/): Main implementation with LangChain, RDFLib, and prompt templating
  - Includes: 
    - Prompt templates for triplet extraction
    - Examples of selective attribute filtering
    - End-to-end demonstration of RDF graph construction and visualization in Jupyter

> ðŸ“‚ See `prompts.py` for configurable templates used in Knowledge Graph construction  
> ðŸ““ See `KG-RDF-creation-grounding-visualisation-BP07-BP08-BestPractice.ipynb` for the executable demo

## Target Audience

- SAP developers building intelligent data apps
- Data scientists implementing AI Core pipelines
- Architects designing graph-powered RAG solutions
